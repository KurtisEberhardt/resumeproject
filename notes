<h1 style = "color: xyz;"></h1> = don't do 

stay within element when designing

<h1 class = ""> class = attribute

in-line style overrides style sheet 

loaded last = wins

h1.title-color specificity = (0,1,1) which is greater than .title-color specificity = (0,1,0)

semantic tags:
    "semantic tags are used to define different parts of a web page"
    ex: <header></header> 
    can use instead of <div></div>
    w3schools 
    ex: <section></section>
never use id tags in styling, use for javascript manipulation
specificity
    id = (1,0,0) 
    class = (0,1,0) 
    tag = (0,0,1)
over-architecting is better than under
bullet points
    <ul>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
ul = unordered list 
li = list items
